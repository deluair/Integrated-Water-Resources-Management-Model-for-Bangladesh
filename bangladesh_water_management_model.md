# Integrated Water Resources Management Model for Bangladesh

## **Executive Summary**

A comprehensive Python-based simulation platform designed to model Bangladesh's complex water resource challenges across coastal salinity intrusion, groundwater depletion, and freshwater scarcity while optimizing water allocation, pricing, and infrastructure systems. Addressing the critical situation where salinity levels surge to three times the safe limit, registering a staggering 3.0 parts per thousand (ppt) in coastal regions, and groundwater depletion of roughly 1 metre each year since 2000 in northwestern Bangladesh and metropolitan Dhaka, this simulator provides evidence-based tools for water managers, policy makers, and agricultural planners to develop sustainable water resource strategies while ensuring food security and economic development.

## **Problem Statement & Bangladesh Context**

### **Critical Multi-Dimensional Water Crisis**
Bangladesh faces a complex water management challenge with severe regional variations. In coastal areas, severe salinity contamination in drinking water and associated human health hazards increase migration risk, while the most alarming revelation unfolds in Satkhira, where shallow water samples from Ashashuni exhibit salinity levels soaring as high as 40.0 ppt â€” equivalent to seawater. Meanwhile, in northern regions, the country withdraws an estimated 32 cubic kilometers (7.7 cubic miles) of groundwater annually, 90% of which is used for irrigation, causing severe depletion.

### **Agricultural Impact & Food Security**
Agricultural productivity is severely threatened across different regions. In coastal areas, soil salinity levels did not significantly differ among the sub-districts, with Assasuni having slightly higher soil salinity (8.24 dS m-1) compared to Dacope (8.08 dS m-1) and Morrelganj (7.96 dS m-1), affecting crop yields and forcing farmers to abandon traditional agriculture. In northern regions, approximately 80% of the agricultural land is irrigated using groundwater after the start of the crop season in Bangladesh, leading to groundwater scarcity arose 42% each year during the operation of STWs in the dry season in northwest Bangladesh.

### **Urban Water Security Crisis**
Urban areas face acute water stress with the water level in several parts of the capital Dhaka has now dropped 60-75 meters [200-245 ft] below the ground surface. According to the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB), fresh water was accessible in central parts of Dhaka at a depth of 20 feet in 1970, but that depth has gone down to 240 feet and below in 2023, while WASA pumps 2.55 million cubic meters of groundwater daily to fulfill the water needs of its over 23 million residents.

### **Water Quality & Health Challenges**
Widespread contamination affects millions with 97% of all drinking water supplies in Bangladesh come from groundwater via hand-operated tubewells, but the shallow groundwater is facing major challenges: (1) widespread, natural contamination of arsenic (As) and salinity in coastal areas and (2) rapid depletion of groundwater storage in intensely irrigated areas. Additionally, despite widespread water access, millions in Bangladesh lack safe drinking water due to contamination by arsenic, salinity and heavy metals.

This comprehensive simulation platform will provide Bangladesh with essential tools for managing its complex water resources sustainably while addressing the interconnected challenges of salinity intrusion, groundwater depletion, and freshwater scarcity. The model addresses the critical need highlighted by experts that the farming communities as a whole rarely adopted water-saving modern technologies and keep paddy fields abundantly irrigated as the marginal cost of irrigation is near zero, providing a framework for implementing sustainable water pricing and management policies.

The simulator enables comprehensive analysis of how different policy interventions can address the challenge that the perspective suggests that the ignorance about the importance of groundwater and the consequent over-extraction cannot be stopped without thorough policy reforms, supporting evidence-based decision making for sustainable water resource management across Bangladesh.
